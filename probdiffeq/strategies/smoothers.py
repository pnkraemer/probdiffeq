    A fixed-point smoother interpolates by

    * Extrapolating from t0 to t, which gives the "filtering" marginal
      and the backward transition from t to t0.
    * Extrapolating from t to t1, which gives another "filtering" marginal
      and the backward transition from t1 to t.
    * Applying the t1-to-t backward transition to compute the interpolation result.
      This intermediate result is informed about its "right-hand side" datum.

    The difference to smoother-interpolation is quite subtle:

    * The backward transition of the value at 't' is merged with that at 't0'.
      The reason is that the backward transition at 't0' knows
      "how to get to the quantity of interest",
      and this is precisely what we want to interpolate.
    * Subsequent interpolations do not continue from the value at 't', but
      from a very similar value where the backward transition
      is replaced with an identity. The reason is that the interpolated solution
      becomes the new quantity of interest, and subsequent interpolations
      need to learn how to get here.
    * Subsequent solver steps do not continue from the value at 't1',
      but the value at 't1' where the backward model is replaced by
      the 't1-to-t' backward model. The reason is similar to the above:
      future steps need to know "how to get back to the quantity of interest",
      which is the interpolated solution.

    These distinctions are precisely why we need three fields
    in every interpolation result:
    the solution,
    the continue-interpolation-from-here,
    and the continue-stepping-from-here.
    All three are different for fixed point smoothers.
    (Really, I try removing one of them monthly and
    then don't understand why tests fail.)
