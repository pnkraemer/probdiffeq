## Examples

There are examples and there are advanced examples.

Consult the examples first. They show how to interact with the API, and explain some useful facts about probabilistic numerical solvers.

The advanced examples show applications of probabilistic numerical solvers, often in conjunction with external libraries.


## Development

### Installation
To install all development-relevant dependencies, install either of
```
pip install probdiffeq[test]  # pytest, ...
pip install probdiffeq[lint]  # black, isort, ...
pip install probdiffeq[example]  # tueplots, diffrax, blackjax, ...
pip install probdiffeq[doc]  # mkdocs, ...
pip install probdiffeq[full]  # all of the above
```

### Continuous integration
Run the checks with a makefile, use either of the below
```
make format
make lint
make test
make example
make doc
```
Remove auxiliary files with 
```
make clean
```
### Pre-commit hook
To ensure that all commits satisfy most of the linters, no big files are addedd accidentally, and so on, use a pre-commit hook
```
pip install pre-commit  # included in `pip install -e .[full]`
pre-commit install
```
You may verify the installation by running
```commandline
pre-commit run
```

### Creating an example notebook

To embed a new example notebook into the docs, follow the steps:

1. Create a jupyter notebook, preferably in `docs/examples/` or `docs/advanced_examples/` and fill it with content.
   If you are wondering which folder is more appropriate: if your notebook introduces an external dependency (for example, an optimisation or sampling library), it is an advanced example.
2. Pair the notebook with a markdown version of the notebook via jupytext
3. Include the notebook into the docs by mentioning it in the `nav` section of `mkdocs.yml`
4. If the notebook is not in `examples/` or in `advanced_examples/`, consider updating the makefile
5. Enjoy.

The same steps kind-of apply to the benchmarks, too.
