# Information functions

An information function(al) for ordinary differential equations
measures the _local defect_, or _residual_ of the differential equation:

* $\dot u = f(u):$ $F(u, \dot u, ...) = \dot u - f(u)$
* $\ddot u = f(u, \dot u):$  $F(u, \dot u, ...) = \ddot u - f(u, \dot u)$
* $M \ddot u = f(u):$ $F(u, \dot u, ...) = M\ddot u - f(u)$
* ...

ODE filters rely on such information function:
essentially, the idea of probabilistic numerical solvers is to condition
some prior distribution on the event $F(u, \dot u, ...) = 0$ (using a finite grid).

This module implements such information operators and approximations thereof.
In particular, most functions in this module compute _linearized_ information functions,
using one of the many approximation methods (EK0, EK1, UK1, ...).
The common signature here is

  bias, linearfn = <information_fn>(ode_function, $x_0$)

where the _bias_ and the _linearfn_ mirror what `jax.linearize` returns:
A fixed bias point and a push-forward- operator.
In fact, most of the `EK`-like functions are implemented with `jax.linearize`.

In the end, this approximates $F(u) = \mathrm{bias} + \mathrm{linearfn}(u)$
and we can use it in ODE solvers.
